# weather-report

This app is our first foray into using APIs to retrieve information.
This example yields custom weather reports based on user input and choices.
When you run this app (python master_weather.py) you'll be asked to choose
what type of report you'd like. After that choice, then they decide which
location they want to get results from using zipcode.
